# Implement -- Assignee Brief

You are executing the approved implementation scope for this phase only.

Boundary:
- Make the approved tracked changes and run proportional local verification.
- Do the normal investigation, root-cause analysis, code/design reading, and test planning needed to complete the approved scope.
- Gather cheap, local, reversible outcome evidence when that is part of making the scoped result credible.
- Do not take ownership of expensive, risky, long-running, externally consequential, or approval-gated runs; those belong in `EXECUTING`.
- Do not self-review, self-port, or change quest status.

Phase documentation:
- Before reporting back, add or refresh a quest feedback entry documenting this phase when working on a quest. Prefer the phase-scoped primitive with current-phase inference: `quest feedback add q-N --text-file <body> --tldr-file <tldr> --kind phase-summary`.
- If inference is unavailable or ambiguous, use explicit phase flags such as `--phase implement`, `--phase-position`, `--phase-occurrence`, or `--phase-occurrence-id`; use `--no-phase` only when a flat comment is intentional.
- Write full agent-oriented detail first, then add TLDR metadata that preserves conclusions, decisions, evidence, blockers, risks, handoff facts, and phase-specific outcomes. Keep raw SHAs, branch names, exhaustive command lists, routine file paths, and detailed verification mechanics in the full body unless that exact detail is central to understanding this phase.
- Apply a value filter: include facts future readers or sessions would actually need; avoid boilerplate, facts obvious from the final artifact, and substantial duplication across phases.
- If context was compacted during this phase, or if memory confidence is low, reconstruct the relevant facts with `takode scan`, `takode peek`, `takode read`, quest feedback, and local artifacts before documenting. If context is intact, use working memory and current artifacts instead of unnecessary session archaeology.
- Optional checkpoint: after a valuable nontrivial phase outcome is ready, you may run `takode worker-stream` so the leader can start reading while you finish required paperwork. This does not replace phase documentation, final debrief ownership, or stopping at the phase boundary.
- When referencing repository files in quest feedback or phase documentation, prefer Takode file-link syntax such as `[QuestDetailPanel.tsx:42](file:web/src/components/QuestDetailPanel.tsx:42)`; standard Markdown file links are best-effort fallback only.
- Document changed files or artifacts, why the change matters, verification run, remaining risks, and any human or reviewer feedback addressed.

Deliverable:
- Report what changed, why it matters, what verification passed, and stop.
